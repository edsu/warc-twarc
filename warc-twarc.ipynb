    "This notebook demonstrates how to use [Webrecorder](http://webrecorder.io) to record a set of search results from Twitter and then extract the Twitter data for those results using [twarc](https://github.com/docnow/twarc). If you'd like to skip the explanation and just use the script from the command line you can find that [here](https://github.com/edsu/warc-twarc/blob/master/warc-twarc.py).\n",

    "## Step 1: Recording a Twitter Search\n",
    "\n",
    "First go to Twitter and [search](https://twitter.com/search/) for something that's of interst. For example you can search for all of Donald Trump's tweets that mention \"fake news\" with the query [from:realDonaldTrump \"fake news\"](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3ArealDonaldTrump%20%22fake%20news%22&src=typd). Check out the [advanced search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced) page for all the ways of fine tuning a search. Note that you can limit by time, which we will return to later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now copy the URL in your browser and head over to [Webrecorder](https://webrecorder.io). Webrecorder lets you record the results of a series of interactions in your browser and download the data as a [WARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) file (more on WARC shortly). You'll probably want to register for an account since anonymous recording sessions will expire after some period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paste the URL for your Twitter search into the box and create a collection using the drop down box:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Webrecorder homepage](images/webrecorder-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you do that you should see a screen something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Webrecorder homepage](images/webrecorder-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you scroll to the bottom of the screen you should see that the page automatically loads more tweets that match the search query. This is the so called *infinite scroll* behavior, where the web browser goes and fetches more tweet from Twitter and puts them into the page automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately Webrecorder records all of these background interactions, and even provides an *autoscroll* function (a button at the top left of the screen). When you click on `autoscroll` Webrecorder will automatically scroll to the bottom of each page, triggering more results. You can let this run until it stops or until you've gotten enough results. **Add note about how much data can be retrieved via the search interface and using the date scoping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done hover over the *record* button just above *autoscroll* and click to *stop* the recording. You will then see a page that lists the recordings in your collection. And you should see the option to download the data (it's a little cloud with an arrow). Move the downloaded file into the directory containing this Jupyter notebook and set the `warc_file` variable."

    "## Step 2: Extracting the Tweet Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our recording our next task is to read it and find all the tweet ids that were mentinoed in the search results. The WARC file is a specialized file that contains all the [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) transactions performed by your web browser with some additional metadata. Fortunately the Webrecorder project have made a small Python library called [warcio](https://github.com/webrecorder/warcio) which makes it much easier to read (and write) WARC data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go and install warcio and a couple other modules we'll be needing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install warcio twarc BeautifulSoup4\n",
    "    \n",
    "The WARC file is broken up into chunks called *records* which can be of different types (request, response, warcinfo). HTTP requests result in HTTP responses, which can be described using warcinfo metadata records. In our case we are interested in the *response* records because we want to look for tweet identifiers in the responses that came back from Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets read through our file and extract the URLs that have been recorded (from the WARC record headers), and also look at the type of content being returned (using the Content-Type HTTP header of the response):\n",

      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status868810404335673344 Sun May 28 12:45:16 +0000 2017 ....it is very possible that those sources don't exist but are made up by fake news writers. #FakeNews is the enemy!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status897223558073602049 Mon Aug 14 22:29:00 +0000 2017 Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status911189860769255424 Fri Sep 22 11:26:06 +0000 2017 The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media \"screaming\" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next, she was a bad candidate!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status923147501418446849 Wed Oct 25 11:21:30 +0000 2017 \"Clinton campaign &amp; DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President.\" @FoxNews\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status914094625488502784 Sat Sep 30 11:48:36 +0000 2017 Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to \"get Trump.\" Not fair to FR or effort!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status920406959320371200 Tue Oct 17 21:51:34 +0000 2017 So much Fake News being put in dying magazines and newspapers. Only place worse may be @NBCNews, @CBSNews, @ABC and @CNN. Fiction writers!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status926481563214376961 Fri Nov 03 16:09:52 +0000 2017 The rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status899625157421039616 Mon Aug 21 13:32:06 +0000 2017 Thank you, the very dishonest Fake News Media is out of control! https://t.co/8J7y900VGK\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status894514535062790144 Mon Aug 07 11:04:19 +0000 2017 ...and West Virginia. The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs.....\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status934563828834164739 Sat Nov 25 23:25:54 +0000 2017 Wow, even I didn’t realize we did so much. Wish the Fake News would report! Thank you. https://t.co/ApVbu2b0Jd\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status914099295963553792 Sat Sep 30 12:07:09 +0000 2017 The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status921829947093733376 Sat Oct 21 20:06:00 +0000 2017 Keep hearing about \"tiny\" amount of money spent on Facebook ads. What about the billions of dollars of Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC &amp; CBS?\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status939967625362276354 Sun Dec 10 21:18:40 +0000 2017 Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status883230130885324802 Fri Jul 07 07:44:07 +0000 2017 I will represent our country well and fight for its interests! Fake News Media will never cover me accurately but who cares! We will #MAGA!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status914465475777695744 Sun Oct 01 12:22:14 +0000 2017 We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico. Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates,...\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status884020939264073728 Sun Jul 09 12:06:30 +0000 2017 ...have it. Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status892383242535481344 Tue Aug 01 13:55:19 +0000 2017 Only the Fake News Media and Trump enemies want me to stop using Social Media (110 million people). Only way for me to get the truth out!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status935147410472480769 Mon Nov 27 14:04:51 +0000 2017 We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!\n",
      "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status913034591879024640 Wed Sep 27 13:36:24 +0000 2017 Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) &amp; @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?\n",
